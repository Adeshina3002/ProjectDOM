# Project_DOM

This project is an attempt to understand DOM. 

It uses the JavaScript event listener to check the particular day it is


It takes input from the user i.e what day it is;


If it is a Monday or Tuesday, the program outputs a **_working day_**


If it is a Wednesday or Thursday, the program outputs a **_boring day_**

Aside from these, the program outputs a **_It's weekend! Let's have fun!!!_**
